I'm a computational biologist specializing in **sequencing** and **imaging** data analysis. I majored in biology for my undergraduate at Seoul National University and joined the [Narry Kim lab](https://narrykim.org){:target="_blank"} to study RNA biology.
During my Ph.D., I carried out diverse next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis to study various coding and noncoding RNAs.
Besides the standard NGS technologies such as bulk or single-cell RNA-seq, I have extensive experience in preparing and analyzing custom RNA-seq libraries. For example, I used [fCLIP-seq](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1046202318300641?via%3Dihub){:target="_blank"} to reveal the endogenously-expressed dsRNA binding repertoire of PKR, and [TAIL-seq](https://www.illumina.com/science/sequencing-method-explorer/kits-and-arrays/tail-seq.html){:target="_blank"} to profile global poly(A)-tail length to study mRNA poly(A) tail regulations.

After I joined the [Chung lab](https://chunglab.org){:target="_blank"} as a postdoc, I focused on hydrogel-based tissue engineering ([review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-019-0250-1){:target="_blank"}) and microscopy imaging data analysis. I developed [eMAP](https://science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf6589){:target="_blank"} which maximally preserves epitopes by purely physical tissue-gel hybridization. It enables superresolution imaging on a cleared and expanded tissue-gel that maintains exceptional antigenicity. Typical datasets I analyzed were large-scale confocal/light-sheet microscopy images of those tissue-gel hybrids, which require dedicated machine learning techniques and efficient parallelization of computation.

As a scientist, my long-term research interest lies in **single-cell** and **spatial genomics** in the RNA biology and therapeutics contexts. I'm particularly interested in revealing cell-to-cell heterogeneity within the healthy and diseased tissue microenvironment. I believe cross-disciplinary approaches utilizing both high-throughput sequencing and imaging techniques would open an avenue for investigating tissue in greater detail at multiple scales, facilitating research and drug developement.

I'm a computational biologist specializing in **sequencing** and **imaging** data analysis. 
I build and develop computational solutions to streamline early clinical research and development. 
At Intellia, I'm focusing on the off-target discovery and validation for the **CRISPR-Cas** gene editing systems for the **cell and gene therapy**.

Before Intellia, I was a postdoc in the [Chung lab](https://chunglab.org){:target="_blank"}.
I had worked on hydrogel-based tissue engineering ([review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-019-0250-1){:target="_blank"}) 
and microscopy imaging data analysis. I developed [eMAP](https://science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf6589){:target="_blank"} 
which enables superresolution imaging on a cleared and expanded tissue-gel that maintains exceptional antigenicity. 
Typical datasets I analyzed were large-scale confocal/light-sheet microscopy images of those tissue-gel hybrids, 
which require dedicated machine learning techniques and efficient parallelization of computation.

Prior to that, I did my PhD in the [Narry Kim lab](https://narrykim.org){:target="_blank"} to study RNA biology.
I carried out diverse next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis to study various noncoding RNAs and mRNA poly(A) tails.
Besides the standard NGS technologies such as bulk or single-cell RNA-seq, 
I have extensive experience in designing and analyzing custom sequencing 
libraries such as fCLIP-seq, TAIL-seq, and mTAIL-seq.

As a scientist, my long-term research interest lies in **single-cell** and **computational genomics** in the therapeutics context.

I'm a computational biologist who specializes in sequencing and imaging data analysis. I majored in Biology for my undergraduate at Seoul National University, and then joined [Narry Kim Lab](https://narrykim.org){:target="_blank"} for my Ph.D. to study post-transcriptional regulations of coding and non-coding RNAs. During my graduate period, I did both wet and computational work with an emphasis on the latter. Besides standard (sc)RNA-seq, I have extensive experience in preparing and analyzing custom RNA-seq datasets, for example, [TAIL-seq](https://www.illumina.com/science/sequencing-method-explorer/kits-and-arrays/tail-seq.html){:target="_blank"} which developed for measuring the mRNA poly(A)-tail length at a global scale.

After I joined Chung Lab as a postdoc, I've been focusing on microscopy image data analysis. The typical datasets I analyze include large-scale confocal/SPIM images of cleared and expanded tissue-gel hybrids ([review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-019-0250-1){:target="_blank"}), which usually require dedicated machine learning techniques and efficient parallelization of computation. I'm developing a new variant of Expansion Microscopy method with my co-workers, and also working on improving the image registration algorithm for multimodal biomedical images.

My current long-term research interest is in the single-cell and spatial genomics in the neuroscience and immunology contexts. I believe a cross-disciplinary approach utilizing both sequencing and imaging techniques would enable us to interrogate biological tissues in greater details at multiple scales.
